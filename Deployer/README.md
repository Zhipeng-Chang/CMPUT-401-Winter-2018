##Possible issue:

You may have the issue of "sudo unable to resolve host"

Solution:

1. ```$cd /etc/```
2. find and look into file "hostname" to check the host name
3. find and open file "hosts" with terminal editor (e.g. nano, vim, etc.)
4. add "127.0.1.1 [your hostname]" under "127.0.0.1 localhost" (notes: no quotation when you type in)
5. save it 
6. go back to run the script
